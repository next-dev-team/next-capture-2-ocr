# OCR Screen Capture App - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A streamlined macOS desktop application that provides quick OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality through screen area capture with minimal configuration overhead.

The app solves the problem of extracting text from any part of the screen efficiently, targeting users who frequently need to digitize text from images, PDFs, or non-selectable content. The product delivers value through its simplicity, speed, and seamless integration with macOS workflows.

## 2. Core Features

No user role distinction required - single-user desktop application.

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our OCR Screen Capture app consists of the following main pages:
1. **Main Configuration Window**: language settings, capture button, shortcut display, status indicators.
2. **Area Selection Overlay**: full-screen transparent overlay, selection rectangle, visual feedback, capture instructions.
3. **System Integration**: global shortcut handling, permission management, system tray (optional).

## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
1. User opens the app and sees the main configuration window
2. User selects preferred OCR language from dropdown
3. User clicks "Capture Area" button or uses global shortcut (Cmd+Shift+2)
4. Main window hides and full-screen selection overlay appears
5. User drags to select area for OCR processing
6. Selection overlay disappears and OCR processing begins
7. Main window reappears showing processing status
8. Extracted text appears in results area and copies to clipboard automatically
9. User can view results or initiate another capture

**Permission Flow (First Launch):**
1. App requests screen recording permission on macOS
2. User is guided to System Preferences to grant permission
3. App verifies permission and enables capture functionality
